# CAS Command-line Shell

To launch into the CAS command-line shell:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] downloadShell runShell
```
{{/shellSupported}}

# Retrieve Overlay Resources

To fetch and overlay a CAS resource or view, use:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] getResource -PresourceName=[resource-name]
```

# Create User Interface Themes Structure

You can use the overlay to construct the correct directory structure for custom user interface themes:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] createTheme -Ptheme=redbeard
```

The generated directory structure should match the following:

```
├── redbeard.properties
├── static
│ └── themes
│     └── redbeard
│         ├── css
│         │ └── cas.css
│         └── js
│             └── cas.js
└── templates
    └── redbeard
        └── fragments
```

HTML templates and fragments can be moved into the above directory structure, 
and the theme may be assigned to applications for use.

# List Overlay Resources
 
To list all available CAS views and templates:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] listTemplateViews
```

To unzip and explode the CAS web application file and the internal resources jar:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] explodeWar
```

# Configuration

- The `etc` directory contains the configuration files and directories that need to be copied to `/etc/cas/config`.

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] copyCasConfiguration
```

- The specifics of the build are controlled using the `gradle.properties` file.

## Configuration Metadata

Configuration metadata allows you to export collection of CAS properties as a report into a file 
that can later be examined. You will find a full list of CAS settings along with notes, types, default and accepted values:

```bash
./gradlew exportConfigMetadata
```                           

{{#puppeteerSupported}}
# Puppeteer

> [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome/Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
> Puppeteer runs in headless mode by default, but can be configured to run in full (non-headless) Chrome/Chromium.

Puppeteer scenarios, used here as a form of acceptance testing, allow you to verify CAS functionality to address a particular authentication flow. The scenarios, which may be
found inside the `./puppeteer/scenarios` directory are designed as small Node.js scripts that spin up a headless browser and walk through a test scenario. You may
design your own test scenarios that verify functionality specific to your CAS deployment or feature.

To execute Puppeteer scenarios, run:

```bash
./puppeteer/run.sh
```

This will first attempt to build your CAS deployment, will install Puppeteer and all other needed libraries. It will then launch the CAS server,
and upon its availability, will iterate through defined scenarios and will execute them one at a time.

The following defaults are assumed:

- CAS will be available at `https://localhost:8443/cas/login`.
- The CAS overlay is prepped with an embedded server container, such as Apache Tomcat.

You may of course need to make adjustments to account for your specific environment and deployment settings, URLs, etc.

# Duct

`duct` is a Gradle task to do quick smoke tests of multi-node CAS high-availability deployments. In particular, it tests correctness of ticket
sharing between multiple individual CAS server nodes backed by distributed ticket registries such as Hazelcast, Redis, etc.

This task requires CAS server nodes to **enable the CAS REST module**. It will **NOT** work without it.

The task accepts the following properties:

- Arbitrary number of CAS server nodes specified via the `duct.cas.X` properties.
- URL of the service application registered with CAS specified via `duct.service`, for which tickets will be requested.
- `duct.username` and `duct.password` to use for authentication, when requesting ticket-granting tickets.

It automates the following scenario:

- Authenticate and issue a service ticket on one CAS node
- Validate this service ticket on the another node
- Repeat (You may cancel and stop the task at any time with `Ctrl+C`)

If the task succeeds, then we effectively have proven that the distributed ticket registry has been set up and deployed
correctly and that there are no connectivity issues between CAS nodes.

To run the task, you may use:

```bash
./gradlew duct
    -Pduct.cas.1=https://node1.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.cas.2=https://node2.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.cas.3=https://node3.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.cas.4=https://node4.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.service=https://apereo.github.io \
    -Pduct.username=casuser \
    -Pduct.password=Mellon
```

You may also supply the following options:

- `duct.debug`: Boolean flag to output debug and verbose logging.
- `duct.duration`: Number of seconds, i.e. `30` to execute the scenario.
- `duct.count`: Number of iterations, i.e. `5` to execute the scenario.
