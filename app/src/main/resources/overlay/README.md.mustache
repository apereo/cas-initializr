# CAS Command-line Shell

To launch into the CAS command-line shell:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] downloadShell runShell
```
{{/shellSupported}}

# Retrieve Overlay Resources

To fetch and overlay a CAS resource or view, use:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] getResource -PresourceName=[resource-name]
```

# Create User Interface Themes Structure

You can use the overlay to construct the correct directory structure for custom user interface themes:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] createTheme -Ptheme=redbeard
```

The generated directory structure should match the following:

```
├── redbeard.properties
├── static
│ └── themes
│     └── redbeard
│         ├── css
│         │ └── cas.css
│         └── js
│             └── cas.js
└── templates
    └── redbeard
        └── fragments
```

HTML templates and fragments can be moved into the above directory structure, 
and the theme may be assigned to applications for use.

# List Overlay Resources
 
To list all available CAS views and templates:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] listTemplateViews
```

To unzip and explode the CAS web application file and the internal resources jar:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] explodeWar
```

# Configuration

- The `etc` directory contains the configuration files and directories that need to be copied to `/etc/cas/config`.

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] copyCasConfiguration
```

- The specifics of the build are controlled using the `gradle.properties` file.

## Configuration Metadata

Configuration metadata allows you to export collection of CAS properties as a report into a file 
that can later be examined. You will find a full list of CAS settings along with notes, types, default and accepted values:

```bash
./gradlew exportConfigMetadata
```

# Puppeteer

> [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome/Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
> Puppeteer runs in headless mode by default, but can be configured to run in full (non-headless) Chrome/Chromium.

Puppeteer scenarios, used here as a form of acceptance testing, allow you to verify CAS functionality to address a particular authentication flow. The scenarios, which may be
found inside the `./puppeteer/scenarios` directory are designed as small Node.js scripts that spin up a headless browser and walk through a test scenario. You may
design your own test scenarios that verify functionality specific to your CAS deployment or feature.

To execute Puppeteer scenarios, run:

```bash
./puppeteer/run.sh
```

This will first attempt to build your CAS deployment, will install Puppeteer and all other needed libraries. It will then launch the CAS server,
and upon its availability, will iterate through defined scenarios and will execute them one at a time.

The following defaults are assumed:

- CAS will be available at `https://localhost:8443/cas/login`.
- The CAS overlay is prepped with an embedded server container, such as Apache Tomcat.

You may of course need to make adjustments to account for your specific environment and deployment settings, URLs, etc.

{{#nativeImageSupported}}
# GraalVM Native Images

Building a GraalVM native image can be done via:

```bash
# You may control the property via gradle.properties
./gradlew nativeCompile -PnativeImage=true
```

This capability requires that you download and install GraalVM with the native-image tool included.
The required GraalVM version is indicated in the `gradle.properties` file.

> Building CAS GraalVM native images can be quite resource intensive and time consuming.
> Depending on the number of modules included in the build, CAS configuration options and the horsepower of the
> build machine, the build time can vary greatly and typically is in the neighborhood of 5~15 minutes and perhaps longer.

This process will invoke the initial AOT processing of the CAS configuration and context, and will then proceed
to build the final native image. The AOT processing engine will always and by default use a `native` application profile.

Once the native image is built, you may run CAS via:

```bash
./build/native/nativeCompile/cas --spring.profiles.active=native
```

# Duct

`duct` is a Gradle task to do quick smoke tests of multi-node CAS high-availability deployments. In particular, it tests correctness of ticket
sharing between multiple individual CAS server nodes backed by distributed ticket registries such as Hazelcast, Redis, etc.

This task requires CAS server nodes to **enable the CAS REST module**. It will **NOT** work without it.

The task accepts the following properties:

- Arbitrary number of CAS server nodes specified via the `duct.cas.X` properties.
- URL of the service application registered with CAS specified via `duct.service`, for which tickets will be requested.
- `duct.username` and `duct.password` to use for authentication, when requesting ticket-granting tickets.

It automates the following scenario:

- Authenticate and issue a service ticket on one CAS node
- Validate this service ticket on the another node
- Repeat (You may cancel and stop the task at any time with `Ctrl+C`)

If the task succeeds, then we effectively have proven that the distributed ticket registry has been set up and deployed
correctly and that there are no connectivity issues between CAS nodes.

To run the task, you may use:

```bash
./gradlew duct
    -Pduct.cas.1=https://node1.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.cas.2=https://node2.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.cas.3=https://node3.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.cas.4=https://node4.example.org/cas \
    -Pduct.service=https://apereo.github.io \
    -Pduct.username=casuser \
    -Pduct.password=Mellon
```

You may also supply the following options:

- `duct.debug`: Boolean flag to output debug and verbose logging.
- `duct.duration`: Number of seconds, i.e. `30` to execute the scenario.
- `duct.count`: Number of iterations, i.e. `5` to execute the scenario.

# OpenRewrite

[OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) is a tool used by the CAS in form of a Gradle plugin
that allows the project to upgrade in place. It works by making changes to the project structure representing
your CAS build and printing the modified files back. Modifications are packaged together in form of upgrade
scripts called `Recipes` that are automatically packaged and presented to the build and may be discovered via:

```bash
./gradlew --init-script openrewrite.gradle rewriteDiscover -PtargetVersion=X.Y.Z --no-configuration-cache | grep "org.apereo.cas"
```

**NOTE:** All CAS specific recipes begin with `org.apereo.cas`. The `targetVersion` must be the CAS version to which you want to upgrade.

OpenRewrite recipes make minimally invasive changes to your CAS build allowing you to upgrade from one version
to the next with minimal effort. The recipe contains *almost* everything that is required for a CAS build system to navigate
from one version to other and automated tedious aspects of the upgrade such as finding the correct versions of CAS,
relevant libraries and plugins as well as any possible structural changes to one's CAS build.

To run, you will need to find and select the name of the recipe first. Then, you can dry-run the selected recipes and see which files would be changed in the build log.
This does not alter your source files on disk at all. This goal can be used to preview the changes that would be made by the active recipes.

```bash
./gradlew --init-script openrewrite.gradle rewriteDryRun -PtargetVersion=X.Y.Z -DactiveRecipe=[recipe name] --no-configuration-cache
```

When you are ready, you can run the actual recipe:

```bash
./gradlew --init-script openrewrite.gradle rewriteRun -PtargetVersion=X.Y.Z -DactiveRecipe=[recipe name] --no-configuration-cache
```

This will run the selected recipes and apply the changes. This will write changes locally to your source files on disk.
Afterward, review the changes, and when you are comfortable with the changes, commit them.
The run goal generates warnings in the build log wherever it makes changes to source files.
