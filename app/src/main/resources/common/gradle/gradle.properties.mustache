version={{casVersion}}

# This is the CAS server version that will be deployed.
# Versions typically are in the format of:
#   [Major].[Minor].[Patch].[Security]
# For patch and security releases and unless explicitly stated otherwise, the below property
# and NOTHING ELSE is the only change you usually need to make to upgrade your CAS deployment.
cas.version={{casVersion}}

# The Spring Boot version is very much tied to the CAS release {{casVersion}}
# and must not be modified or upgraded out of band, as doing so would most likely
# jeopardize the stability of your CAS deployment leading to unpredictable behavior.

# Before changing the JDK versions here, you must account for the following:
# - Dependency Compatibility: Ensure that all libraries and frameworks you use are compatible with Java {{javaVersion}} and above.
# - Environment Compatibility: Check that your deployment environments (e.g., servers, CI/CD pipelines, cloud services) support Java {{javaVersion}} and above.
# Remember that this CAS build does and will only officially support Java {{javaVersion}}. Do NOT change platform requirements unless
# you really know what you are doing and are comfortable managing the deployment and its risks completely on your own.

# This property defines the version of Java that your source code is written in.
# It ensures that your code is compatible with the specified version of the Java language.
# Gradle will expect your source code to be compatible with JDK {{javaVersion}}.
sourceCompatibility={{javaVersion}}

# This property specifies the version of the Java runtime that the compiled bytecode should be compatible with.
# It ensures that the bytecode generated by the compiler will run on JDK {{javaVersion}}.
targetCompatibility={{javaVersion}}

# This property controls the JVM vendor that is used by Gradle toolchains.
# You may want to build CAS using a Java version that is not supported for running Gradle
# by setting this property to the vendor of the JDK you want to use.
# If Gradle can’t find a locally available toolchain that matches the requirements 
# of the build, it can automatically download one.
# Options include: AMAZON, ADOPTIUM, JETBRAINS, MICROSOFT, ORACLE, SAP, BELLSOFT, etc.
# Setting this to a blank or invalid value will force Gradle to use the JDK installation on the build machine.
jvmVendor=AMAZON

# This plugin controls how JDK distributions required by the Grtadle toolchain
# are discovered, and downloaded when necessary.
# Note that auto-provisioning of a JDK distribution only kicks in when auto-detection fails 
# to find a matching JDK, and auto-provisioning can only download new JDKs and is in no way 
# involved in updating any of the already installed ones.
