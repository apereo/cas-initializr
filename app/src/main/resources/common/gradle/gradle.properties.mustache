# - Environment Compatibility: Check that your deployment environments (e.g., servers, CI/CD pipelines, cloud services) support Java {{javaVersion}} and above.
# Remember that this CAS build does and will only officially support Java {{javaVersion}}. Do NOT change platform requirements unless
# you really know what you are doing and are comfortable managing the deployment and its risks completely on your own.

# This property defines the version of Java that your source code is written in.
# It ensures that your code is compatible with the specified version of the Java language.
# Gradle will expect your source code to be compatible with JDK {{javaVersion}}.

# This property specifies the version of the Java runtime that the compiled bytecode should be compatible with.
